## Description ##
-----------------

Neptune locates genomic signatures using an exact k-mer matching strategy while
accommodating k-mer mismatches. The software identifies sequences that are
sufficiently represented within inclusion targets and sufficiently absent from
exclusion targets. The signature discovery process is accomplished using
probabilistic models instead of heuristic strategies.

## Release ##
-------------

**Neptune 1.2.2**

2016 April 6

This release includes some Galaxy improvements and fixes a signature scoring
problem.

## Running Neptune ##
---------------------

Neptune's command line arguments can be found by running:

	$ neptune --help

A simple example of running Neptune:

	$ neptune --inclusion /path/to/inclusion/ --exclusion /path/to/exclusion/
		--output /path/to/output/

Please refer to the documentation for more details.
