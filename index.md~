# Neptune #

Neptune locates genomic signatures using an exact *k*-mer matching strategy while accommodating *k*-mer mismatches. The software identifies sequences that are sufficiently represented within inclusion targets and sufficiently absent from exclusion targets. The signature discovery process is guided by probabilistic models instead of heuristic strategies. Neptune identifies general-purpose signatures are agnostic of application-specific requirements, such as physical and chemical properties, and may require further investigation to determine their appropriateness for application.
